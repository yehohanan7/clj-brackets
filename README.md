clj-brackets
============
A Simple [Adobe Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) plugin to evaulate Clojure expressions in Brackets! 

## Installation
Download the extension [clj-brackets.zip](https://github.com/yehohanan7/clj-brackets/blob/master/download/clj-brackets.zip) 

Open Brackets' extension folder by clicking on 'help' -> 'Show Extensions Folder'
in Brackets and then extracting the downloaded extension into the user folder.

## Start Wrepl
Open a terminal and navigate to your Clojure project
and start the [wrepl](https://github.com/yehohanan7/wrepl),
which will start the HTTP REPL on port 7777

## Happy hacking
Now you can evaluate Clojure expressions in Brackets by selecting the expression
and firing the keyboard event: cmd+E
